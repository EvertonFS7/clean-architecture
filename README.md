# Forum with Clean Architecture & DDD

This project was designed following the principles of **Clean Architecture** and **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**. The goal is to ensure that the codebase is modular, testable, and intuitive, making both development and future maintenance easier.

## Clean Architecture

The adoption of the **Clean Architecture** model is fundamental in this project. It ensures that the domain logic and business rules are kept independent of specific implementation details, such as user interface (UI), frameworks, and databases. This separation promotes a decoupled system, offering significant benefits in terms of scalability and testability.

## Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

DDD complements Clean Architecture by focusing on the heart of the project: the application's domain. It emphasizes the importance of rich and expressive modeling, facilitating the implementation of business complexities in an intuitive and flexible way.

### Benefits

- **Modularity**: Facilitates development and maintenance through clear separation of responsibilities.
- **Testability**: The layer separation and focus on the domain make unit and integration testing easier.
- **Ease of Understanding**: The organized structure and domain-oriented principles make the code more readable and understandable.

This project is a practical demonstration of how Clean Architecture and DDD can be applied to create robust, scalable, and maintainable systems.
